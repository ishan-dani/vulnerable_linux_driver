# vulnerable_linux_driver
An intentionally vulnerable linux driver for research purposes/practice in kernel exploit dev

This is based off the awesome work from the hacksys team who did the vulnerable windows driver: https://github.com/hacksysteam/HackSysExtremeVulnerableDriver

These are not CTF style challenges, the vulnerabilities are extremely obvious, the focus is one understanding kernel exploit dev.

The vulnerable linux driver is developed for security enthusiast lo learn and polish their linux exploitation skills on Ring 0.
